# Tetris-Game-Project

## Game description

Everybody knows (and maybe loves) the game of Tetris. It was created in 1984 by Alexey Pajitnov and it became very popular in the '90s. 
Its popularity made the game one of the classics.

I chose this game for my robotics project because it was one of my favourites growing up and I played it so much in my attempt to kill the boredom in school.

## How to play

Tetris is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, called "tetriminos", descend from the top of the field. 

During this descent, the player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it. The player can neither slow down the falling pieces nor stop them, but can accelerate them. 

The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many horizontal lines of blocks as possible. 

When a line is completed, it disappears, and the blocks placed above fall one rank, while also granting the player points. 

If the player cannot make the blocks disappear quickly enough, the field will start to fill, and when the pieces reach the top of the field and prevent the arrival of additional pieces, the game ends.

At the end of each game, the player receives a score based on the number of lines that have been completed.

The game never ends with the player's victory; the player can only complete as many lines as possible before an inevitable loss.

My version of the game grants the player 3 lives at the start of the game and the score is calculated adding all the points won in those 3 lives.

Also, the higher you choose the difficulty, the faster the pieces will fall, but you can win more points this way.
